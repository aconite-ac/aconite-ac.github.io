<h2 id="computers-and-theorem-proving"><a class="header" href="#computers-and-theorem-proving">Computers and Theorem Proving</a></h2>
<p><em>Formal verification</em> involves the use of logical and computational methods to establish claims that are expressed in
precise mathematical terms. These can include ordinary mathematical theorems, as well as claims that pieces of hardware
or software, network protocols, and mechanical and hybrid systems meet their specifications. In practice, there is not a
sharp distinction between verifying a piece of mathematics and verifying the correctness of a system: formal
verification requires describing hardware and software systems in mathematical terms, at which point establishing claims
as to their correctness becomes a form of theorem proving. Conversely, the proof of a mathematical theorem may require a
lengthy computation, in which case verifying the truth of the theorem requires verifying that the computation does what
it is supposed to do.</p>
<p>The gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to provide a proof, and twentieth-century developments in logic
show most if not all conventional proof methods can be reduced to a small set of axioms and rules in any of a number of
foundational systems. With this reduction, there are two ways that a computer can help establish a claim: it can help
find a proof in the first place, and it can help verify that a purported proof is correct.</p>
<p><em>Automated theorem proving</em> focuses on the &quot;finding&quot; aspect. Resolution theorem provers, tableau theorem provers, fast
satisfiability solvers, and so on provide means of establishing the validity of formulas in propositional and
first-order logic. Other systems provide search procedures and decision procedures for specific languages and domains,
such as linear or nonlinear expressions over the integers or the real numbers. Architectures like SMT (&quot;satisfiability
modulo theories&quot;) combine domain-general search methods with domain-specific procedures. Computer algebra systems and
specialized mathematical software packages provide means of carrying out mathematical computations, establishing
mathematical bounds, or finding mathematical objects. A calculation can be viewed as a proof as well, and these systems,
too, help establish mathematical claims.</p>
<p>Automated reasoning systems strive for power and efficiency, often at the expense of guaranteed soundness. Such systems
can have bugs, and it can be difficult to ensure that the results they deliver are correct. In contrast, <em>interactive
theorem proving</em> focuses on the &quot;verification&quot; aspect of theorem proving, requiring that every claim is supported by a
proof in a suitable axiomatic foundation. This sets a very high standard: every rule of inference and every step of a
calculation has to be justified by appealing to prior definitions and theorems, all the way down to basic axioms and
rules. In fact, most such systems provide fully elaborated &quot;proof objects&quot; that can be communicated to other systems and
checked independently. Constructing such proofs typically requires much more input and interaction from users, but it
allows you to obtain deeper and more complex proofs.</p>
<p>The <em>Lean Theorem Prover</em> aims to bridge the gap between interactive and automated theorem proving, by situating
automated tools and methods in a framework that supports user interaction and the construction of fully specified
axiomatic proofs. The goal is to support both mathematical reasoning and reasoning about complex systems, and to verify
claims in both domains.</p>
<p>Lean's underlying logic has a computational interpretation, and Lean can be viewed equally well as a programming
language. More to the point, it can be viewed as a system for writing programs with a precise semantics, as well as
reasoning about the functions that the programs compute. Lean also has mechanisms to serve as its own <em>metaprogramming
language</em>, which means that you can implement automation and extend the functionality of Lean using Lean itself. These
aspects of Lean are explored in a companion tutorial to this one, <a href="TBD">Programming in Lean 4</a>, though computational
aspects of the system will make an appearance here.</p>
<h2 id="about-lean"><a class="header" href="#about-lean">About Lean</a></h2>
<p>The <em>Lean</em> project was launched by Leonardo de Moura at Microsoft Research Redmond in 2013. It is an ongoing, long-term
effort, and much of the potential for automation will be realized only gradually over time. Lean is released under the
<a href="LICENSE">Apache 2.0 license</a>, a permissive open source license that permits others to use and extend the code and
mathematical libraries freely.</p>
<p>To install Lean in your computer consider using the <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/master/doc/quickstart.md">Quickstart</a> instructions. The Lean source code, and instructions for building Lean, are available at
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/</a>.</p>
<p>This tutorial describes the current version of Lean, known as Lean 4.</p>
<h2 id="about-this-book"><a class="header" href="#about-this-book">About this Book</a></h2>
<p>This book is designed to teach you to develop and verify proofs in Lean. Much of the background information you will
need in order to do this is not specific to Lean at all. To start with, you will learn the logical system that Lean is
based on, a version of <em>dependent type theory</em> that is powerful enough to prove almost any conventional mathematical
theorem, and expressive enough to do it in a natural way. More specifically, Lean is based on a version of a system
known as the Calculus of Constructions with inductive types. Lean can not only define mathematical objects and express
mathematical assertions in dependent type theory, but it also can be used as a language for writing proofs.</p>
<p>Because fully detailed axiomatic proofs are so complicated, the challenge of theorem proving is to have the computer
fill in as many of the details as possible. You will learn various methods to support this in <a href="dependent_type_theory.html">dependent type
theory</a>. For example, term rewriting, and Lean's automated methods for simplifying terms and
expressions automatically. Similarly, methods of <em>elaboration</em> and <em>type inference</em>, which can be used to support
flexible forms of algebraic reasoning.</p>
<p>Finally, you will learn about features that are specific to Lean, including the language you use to communicate
with the system, and the mechanisms Lean offers for managing complex theories and data.</p>
<p>Throughout the text you will find examples of Lean code like the one below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lean">theorem and_commutative (p q : Prop) : p ∧ q → q ∧ p :=
  fun hpq : p ∧ q =&gt;
  have hp : p := And.left hpq
  have hq : q := And.right hpq
  show q ∧ p from And.intro hq hp
</code></pre>
<p>If you are reading the book inside of <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>, you will see a button that reads &quot;try it!&quot; Pressing the button copies the example to your editor with enough surrounding context to make the code compile correctly. You can type
things into the editor and modify the examples, and Lean will check the results and provide feedback continuously as you
type. We recommend running the examples and experimenting with the code on your own as you work through the chapters
that follow. You can open this book on VS Code by using the command &quot;Lean 4: Open Documentation View&quot;.</p>
